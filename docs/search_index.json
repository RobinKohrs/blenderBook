Preprocessing QGIS All possible geodata must be in the same projection Clip and resample Rescale to UInt16so that each pixel holds a value between 0 and \\(2^{16}\\) I need to adjust that such that the places that were once were the minimum become 0, and the places that were once were the maximnum become 65,535, \\[\\frac{pixel value - Minimum}{maximum - pixelvalue} * 65535 \\] Luckily there is the rescale function already in qgis Save as 16 Bit unsigned integer: For that there is the translate (change format) tool in qgis. A correponding gdal command looks like this: gdal_translate -ot UInt16 -of GTiff /home/robink/projects/qgis/data/dem/bawü/hohenwielRescaled065535.tif /home/robink/projects/qgis/data/dem/bawü/hohenwielRescaled065535_uint.tif 4.2 2. Moving to Blender 4.2.1 Rendering engine Change the rendering engine to cycles Check the experimental feature set 4.3 3. Add and prepare the plane Move it to the center Set x,y,z to 0 Aspect ratio of the plane must match the aspect ration of the dem Chage the values of the Scales field to match the ration of the heightmap E.g. a heightmap with 3000 x 2000 Pixels would have a 3 x 2 ratio here Add a new Material CLicking the red globe icon and make sure it is the principal bsdf shader Change to the Shader Editor and add a Image texture Displacement modifier Connect the color from the image texture to the height of the displacement And the displacement of the displacement to the displacement in the material output ### The Camera Set the location to the center of the coordinate system just above Make it point downward by also changing the rotation to 0,0,0 4.3.1 Set the dimensions of the outputted image to match the dem Now the camera aspect ration should match the aspcet ratio of the plane 4.3.2 Set ortographic view Change the camera to be an orthographic, rather than a point like camera For the camera to match the entire dem change the scale to match exactly \\[2 \\times largest Scale\\] - As our image is 947 * 502 pixel I set the largest scale to be 9.47. So I plug 18.94 in here and it should match the DEM "]]
